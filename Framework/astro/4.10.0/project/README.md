# Astro Web Application Example

This is a modern web application example built with Astro 4.10.0, a modern frontend framework that delivers lightning-fast performance by shipping minimal JavaScript and leveraging a component-based architecture.

## Project Description

This project creates a static website using Astro. The application demonstrates Astro's core features, including its component-based structure, file-based routing, and partial hydration capabilities. The development server listens on port 4321 and provides hot reloading for a smooth development experience. Astro's "Islands Architecture" allows for selective hydration of interactive components, resulting in optimized performance by keeping most of the site as static HTML with minimal JavaScript shipped to the client.

## Environment

This project runs on a Debian 12 system with Node.js and Astro 4.10.0, which is pre-configured in the Devbox environment. You don't need to worry about setting up Node.js, npm, or Astro dependencies yourself. The development environment includes all necessary tools for building and running Astro applications. If you need to make adjustments to match your specific requirements, you can modify the configuration files accordingly.

## Project Execution

**Development mode:** For normal development environment, simply enter Devbox and run `bash entrypoint.sh` in the terminal. This will start the Astro development server with hot-reload enabled.

**Production mode:** After release, the project will be automatically packaged into a Docker image and deployed according to the `entrypoint.sh` script with production parameters (run `bash entrypoint.sh production`). This will build a static site optimized for production and serve it using the preview server.


DevBox: Code. Build. Deploy. We've Got the Rest.

With DevBox, you can focus entirely on writing great code while we handle the infrastructure, scaling, and deployment. Seamless development from start to production.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
