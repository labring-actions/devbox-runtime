# Quarkus Web Application Example

This is a modern Java web application example built with Quarkus 3.16.1, a Kubernetes Native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, designed to optimize Java specifically for container environments.

## Project Description

This project creates a lightweight RESTful web service using Quarkus. The application demonstrates Quarkus's fast startup time, low memory footprint, and developer-friendly features like live coding. The server listens on port 8080 and provides simple REST endpoints that return "Hello from Quarkus REST" messages. Quarkus's reactive programming model ensures efficient handling of web requests, making it ideal for microservices and cloud-native applications.

## Environment

This project runs on a Debian 12 system with Java 17 and Quarkus 3.16.1, which is pre-configured in the Devbox environment. You don't need to worry about setting up Java, Maven, or Quarkus dependencies yourself. The development environment includes all necessary tools for building and running Quarkus applications. If you need to make adjustments to match your specific requirements, you can modify the configuration files accordingly.

## Project Execution

**Development mode:** For normal development environment, simply enter Devbox and run `bash entrypoint.sh` in the terminal. This will start the Quarkus application in development mode with hot-reload enabled.

**Production mode:** After release, the project will be automatically packaged into a Docker image and deployed according to the `entrypoint.sh` script with production parameters (run `bash entrypoint.sh production`). This will build an optimized JAR and run the application.


DevBox: Code. Build. Deploy. We've Got the Rest.

With DevBox, you can focus entirely on writing great code while we handle the infrastructure, scaling, and deployment. Seamless development from start to production.







# code-with-quarkus

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it's not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
