# Express.js Web Application Example

This is a modern Node.js web application example built with Express.js 4.21.0, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

## Project Description

This project creates a lightweight web server using Express.js. The application demonstrates Express's core features, including its simple routing system and middleware architecture. The server listens on port 3000 and provides a basic endpoint that returns a "Hello World!" message. Express's flexible and minimalist design makes it ideal for building RESTful APIs, web applications, and microservices with clean, maintainable code.

## Environment

This project runs on a Debian 12 system with Node.js and Express.js 4.21.0, which is pre-configured in the Devbox environment. You don't need to worry about setting up Node.js, npm, or Express dependencies yourself. The development environment includes all necessary tools for building and running Express applications. If you need to make adjustments to match your specific requirements, you can modify the configuration files accordingly.

## Project Execution

**Development mode:** For normal development environment, simply enter Devbox and run `bash entrypoint.sh` in the terminal. This will install development dependencies and start the Express application with auto-reloading capabilities.

**Production mode:** After release, the project will be automatically packaged into a Docker image and deployed according to the `entrypoint.sh` script with production parameters (run `bash entrypoint.sh production`). This will install only production dependencies and run the Express application in production mode.


DevBox: Code. Build. Deploy. We've Got the Rest.

With DevBox, you can focus entirely on writing great code while we handle the infrastructure, scaling, and deployment. Seamless development from start to production.
