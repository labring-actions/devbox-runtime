# Next.js Web Application Example

This is a modern React framework application example built with Next.js 14.2.5, a powerful full-stack framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes with React.

## Project Description

This project creates a server-rendered React application using Next.js. The application demonstrates Next.js's core features, including its file-based routing system, server components, image optimization, and CSS modules. The development server listens on port 3000 and provides hot-reloading for a smooth development experience. Next.js's hybrid rendering capabilities allow for optimized performance through both server-side rendering and static site generation, making it ideal for SEO-friendly web applications.

## Environment

This project runs on a Debian 12 system with Node.js and Next.js 14.2.5, which is pre-configured in the Devbox environment. You don't need to worry about setting up Node.js, npm, or Next.js dependencies yourself. The development environment includes all necessary tools for building and running Next.js applications. If you need to make adjustments to match your specific requirements, you can modify the configuration files accordingly.

## Project Execution

**Development mode:** For normal development environment, simply enter Devbox and run `bash entrypoint.sh` in the terminal. This will start the Next.js development server with hot-reload enabled.

**Production mode:** After release, the project will be automatically packaged into a Docker image and deployed according to the `entrypoint.sh` script with production parameters (run `bash entrypoint.sh production`). This will build an optimized production build and start the Next.js production server.
