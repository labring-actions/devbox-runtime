# Django Web Application Example

This is a modern Python web application example built with Django 4.2.16, a high-level web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design with its "batteries-included" philosophy.

## Project Description

This project creates a comprehensive web application using Django. The application follows Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture and demonstrates the framework's key features, including its powerful ORM, automatic admin interface, and robust security systems. The server listens on port 8000 and uses SQLite as the default database. Django's extensive built-in functionality makes it ideal for building complex, database-driven websites and applications with less code and more flexibility.

## Environment

This project runs on a Debian 12 system with Python and Django 4.2.16, which is pre-configured in the Devbox environment. You don't need to worry about setting up Python, virtual environments, or Django dependencies yourself. The development environment includes all necessary tools for building and running Django applications. If you need to make adjustments to match your specific requirements, you can modify the configuration files accordingly.

## Project Execution

**Development mode:** For normal development environment, simply enter Devbox and run `bash entrypoint.sh` in the terminal. This will activate the virtual environment and start the Django development server with increased verbosity for better debugging information.

**Production mode:** After release, the project will be automatically packaged into a Docker image and deployed according to the `entrypoint.sh` script with production parameters (run `bash entrypoint.sh production`). This will start the Django application in a more production-like environment.


DevBox: Code. Build. Deploy. We've Got the Rest.

With DevBox, you can focus entirely on writing great code while we handle the infrastructure, scaling, and deployment. Seamless development from start to production.
