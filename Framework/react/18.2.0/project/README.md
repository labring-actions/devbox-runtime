# React Web Application Example

This is a modern frontend application example built with React 18.2.0, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces known for its component-based architecture and efficient virtual DOM rendering.

## Project Description

This project creates a single-page application using Create React App with TypeScript. The application demonstrates React's core concepts, including component structure, state management, and responsive design. The development server listens on port 3000 and provides hot reloading for a smooth development experience. TypeScript integration ensures type safety, improving code quality and development efficiency.

## Environment

This project runs on a Debian 12 system with Node.js and React 18.2.0, which is pre-configured in the Devbox environment. You don't need to worry about setting up Node.js, npm, or React dependencies yourself. The development environment includes all necessary tools for building and running React applications. If you need to make adjustments to match your specific requirements, you can modify the configuration files accordingly.

## Project Execution

**Development mode:** For normal development environment, simply enter Devbox and run `bash entrypoint.sh` in the terminal. This will start the React development server with hot-reload enabled.

**Production mode:** After release, the project will be automatically packaged into a Docker image and deployed according to the `entrypoint.sh` script with production parameters (run `bash entrypoint.sh production`). This will build optimized static files and serve them using the serve server.


DevBox: Code. Build. Deploy. We've Got the Rest.

With DevBox, you can focus entirely on writing great code while we handle the infrastructure, scaling, and deployment. Seamless development from start to production.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
