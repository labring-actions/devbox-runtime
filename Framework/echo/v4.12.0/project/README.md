# Echo Web Application Example

This is a modern Go web application example built with Echo v4.12.0, a high-performance, extensible, minimalist web framework for Go that provides a robust set of features with excellent performance.

## Project Description

This project creates a lightweight RESTful web service using Echo. The application demonstrates Echo's core features, including its middleware system, context-based handler interface, and efficient HTTP router. The server listens on port 8080 and provides a simple endpoint that returns a "Hello, World!" message. Echo's performance-focused design, built-in middleware, and intuitive API make it ideal for building high-throughput RESTful services and web applications with clean, maintainable code.

## Environment

This project runs on a Debian 12 system with Go and Echo v4.12.0, which is pre-configured in the Devbox environment. You don't need to worry about setting up Go, dependencies, or Echo framework yourself. The development environment includes all necessary tools for building and running Go applications. If you need to make adjustments to match your specific requirements, you can modify the configuration files accordingly.

## Project Execution

**Development mode:** For normal development environment, simply enter Devbox and run `bash entrypoint.sh` in the terminal. This will run the Echo application directly from source code using `go run main.go`.

**Production mode:** After release, the project will be automatically packaged into a Docker image and deployed according to the `entrypoint.sh` script with production parameters (run `bash entrypoint.sh production`). This will build an optimized executable binary and run the application.


DevBox: Code. Build. Deploy. We've Got the Rest.

With DevBox, you can focus entirely on writing great code while we handle the infrastructure, scaling, and deployment. Seamless development from start to production.
